## Decisions:

- Code Readability > Bundle Size

  - intuitive at first glance
  - simple: do one thing well
  - reuse as much as possible

- Test Driven Dev
  - test functionality before design
  - mocked data + api calls

## Cleanup on final code:

- pages auto loggedin as `johnsmith` on development mode
